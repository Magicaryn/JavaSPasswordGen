# JavaSPasswordGen
challenge 3 JavaScript password generator 

This application is an easy way to create unique, randomized passwords that match whatever criteria that you wish to follow. When you hit the generate button the application will ask you a series of questions in prompts including length of password, uppercase, lowercase, numbers and if you want symbols included in the password. 

This challenge was very tricky for me as during my classes i felt i understood the material but when it came to applying what i learned, i struggled. Once I realized what i was missing in the application it worked out well but it was a bit of work to figure it out. I appreciated the challenge and cant wait to work more with javascript.
