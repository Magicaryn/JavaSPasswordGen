# JavaSPasswordGen
challenge 3 JavaScript password generator 

This application is an easy way to create unique randomized passwords that match whatever criteria that you wish to follow. When you hit the generate button the application will ask you a series of questions in prompts including length of password and what types of characters to include in the password. 

This challenge was very tricky for me as during my classes i felt i understood the material but when it came to application i struggled. Once I realixed what i was missing in the application it worked out well but it was a bit of a struggle to figure it out.
